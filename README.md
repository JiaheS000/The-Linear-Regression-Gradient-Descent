# The-Linear-Regression-Gradient-Descent
This is a small Lab work from the Machine Learning course. The purpose is to find the target cities for a chain restaurant to expand its commercial empire. By using the linear regression and the gradient descent technique to find an equation to predict whether a city is a good target to expand or not.   

The X value represents the population of the candidate cities times 10000. (for example, 6.10 means the city has 61000 long-term residents) 

The Y value is the possible monthly profit in the specific city. The actual profit is the y value times 10000. (For instance, 17.592 represents $175,920 in average monthly profits for that city.) In addition, the negative number represents the loss.
